## Details for Instructors

### Compiling Slides and Running Locally

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v6)
2. Run `npm install` from this repository's directory
3. Run `gem install sass` to install Sass. Note: You will need to [download Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation) to run this `gem` command.
4. Run `grunt` from this repository's directory to compile files. A window will open with the slides running locally. Any changes will automatically refresh.

Make CSS changes to the source files, **not** the compiled CSS files (i.e. **not** those in `/dist`). Source files can be found in `/src/css` as `.scss` files.

### Teaching Tips and Recommendations

- Slide-specific notes can be found in presenter mode. To enter presenter mode, press the `S` key when viewing the slides in a browser.
- All CodePen solutions have a class of `solution solution__lesson-X` where X is the lesson number (1, 2, or 3) and are hidden from the slides by default. When you're ready to reveal solutions for a given class, uncomment out `display: inline;` in the `src/css/theme/source/gdidarkblue.scss` file. Typically solutions are revealed after each lesson ends.

### How to Use Reveal.js Slides

**Key Functions:**
- Enter speaker view by pressing `s`
- View PDF/print mode by going to `http://yourslidesurl/?print-pdf` 

**Additional Info:**

Please read our slide creation guidelines in [the wiki](https://github.com/girldevelopit/gdi-slides-template/wiki). Be sure to make your course's content as reusable as possible &mdash; remove any information about yourself or your chapter.
