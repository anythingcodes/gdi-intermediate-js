# Intermediate JavaScript

If you've completed Intro to JS and are ready for the next level, join us for a dive into the more advanced aspects of JavaScript! Now that you have a basic understanding of programming and JavaScript fundamentals, it's time to get down with some true DOM manipulation. Use those loops, objects, conditional statements and more to turn your web pages into interactive sites. In this four hour, two part course, we'll start building and debugging a true web-based application with dynamic, interactive content.

## Dates

This class takes place over the following dates:

**Day, Month Xth, H:MM - H:MM tt**

**Day, Month Xth, H:MM - H:MM tt**

Your payment registers you for the entire series.

## Prerequisites

You should understand programming basics like variables, data types, loops and conditional statements. You also are very familiar with the anatomy of the DOM. Your HTML & CSS skills are fairly advanced and you have no problem writing a quick CSS selector to change the font size of each paragraph on the page. Your JavaScript-specific experience is still pretty beginner, though. You may have dabbled in some DOM manipulation, experimented with vanilla JavaScript, or even done a bit of jQuery on your own, but working with JavaScript is still pretty new to you.

This class is intended for JavaScript beginners who haven't yet done too much with DOM manipulation or who'd like to use JavaScript for common, everyday projects.
